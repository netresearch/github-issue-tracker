# Session script

## Intro

- [ ] Welcome to Fridays. The place for colleagues from Netresearch in Leipzig to exchange ideas about new technologies and solutions. Everyone who wants to meets once a week for 1 hour remotely or directly in our office in the kitchen at the Fridays MeetUp; Fridays for short.
- [ ] We at Netresearch love Open Source. It is not uncommon for us to find a solution from the open source community to the question of which software solves the customer's problem. So we not only love Open Source, we also live from it. TYPO3, Magento, Shopware, Akeneo, React Native and OROCRM offer our customers a good basis for individually tailored software. But we don't just take, we also give something back to the community. Our three most popular projects on GitHub are the *composer-patches-plugin*, the Magento tool *jumpstorm* and the TYPO3 backend extension for the CKEditor *t3x-rte_ckeditor_image* for using images within texts.
- [ ] Netresearch currently maintains **190** open source projects on GitHub under the organisation account *netresearch* as of summer 2022. We welcome contributions and try to respond as quickly as possible to bug reports or other requests from the community. To keep track of the number of open tickets, we would like to set up a display in the kitchen of our office that shows the current number of open tickets on GitHub. This should help and motivate us to react quickly to requests from the community.
- [ ] We will access the GitHup API with a microcontroller, the ESP8266, and summarise the corresponding data with C++ and show the result on an LED display. Afterwards, we will design a picture frame in which we will integrate the technology.
- [ ] We have exactly 1 hour left. The time schedule is sporty, but we are all working in parallel on different parts of the project.
- [ ] "We" that is [PARTICIPANTS].
  - [ ] X will write the documentation.
  - [ ] X will develop the software.
  - [ ] X will take care of the hardware.
- [ ] So this video is not directly a tutorial, more of a challenge, but we will publish our documentation with the parts list, schematic and the software in a GitHub repository to rebuild.

## 1. hardware

- [ ] What hardware do we need?
- [ ] How long will the battery last?

## 2. software

- [ ] What does the software need to do? What are the functions?
- [ ] How often should the data be updated?

## Assembly

- [ ] How do we get the software onto the microcontroller?
- [ ] Is there anything to consider?
- [ ] What about security, does the software need regular updates?

## Demonstration and conclusion

- [ ] What could be done better?
